{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This is a quick post to introduce myself and write a few lines about the intentions behind this blog. </p>\n<p>I am a Front-end developer and designer living in Lausanne, Switzerland. My background is design-focused as I have a BA in Visual Communication. My coding skills come from self-learning.</p>\n<p>These past years I have been at an agency and grew more and more interest in the Front-end development scene. It quickly became clear to me that shooting out mocks and wireframes wasn't enough for my taste. I like to actually build the products that I design and code is now my tool of preference when it comes to creating a product. </p>\n<p>Currently I'm mostly focused on finding a new role as a UX Enginner. Aside from that I'm tackling fun JAMstack stuff and getting more involved in the open source space.</p>\n<p>With this blog I want to share more! Writing is a great way to teach, learn and get involved with the community. Talking about where coding needs opinions, focus on UX and usability Design point of viewcase studies of personal projects</p>\n<p>That's it for now. If you want to get some smaller updates, you can <a href=\"https:twitter.com/nelsreitz\">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>Outside of the tech domain, I usually try to spend my time away from screens: I draw, play music, hike and enjoy some sports.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Welcome to the blog!"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/welcome-to-the-blog/"}}
