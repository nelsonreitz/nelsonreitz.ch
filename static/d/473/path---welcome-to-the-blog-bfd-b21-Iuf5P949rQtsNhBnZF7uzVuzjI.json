{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This is a quick post to introduce myself and write a few lines about the intentions behind this blog. </p>\n<p>I am a Front-end developer and designer living in Lausanne, Switzerland. My background and my studies are mostly design-focused and my coding skills come from self-learning.</p>\n<p>These past years I have been at an agency and quickly shooting out mocks and wireframes wasn't enough for me since I like to actually build the products that I design. Code is now my tool of preference when it comes to designing a product. Today I'm very comfortable with coding layouts with responsive design and robust component design.</p>\n<p>Currently I'm mostly focused with fun JAMstack stuff and getting more involved in the open source space.</p>\n<p>Outside of the tech domain, I usually try to spend my time away from screens: I draw, play music, hike and try some sports.</p>\n<p>With this blog I want to share more! Writing is a great way to teach, learn and get involved with the community. Talking about where coding needs opinions, focus on UX and usability Design point of viewcase studies of personal projects</p>\n<p>That's it for now.
