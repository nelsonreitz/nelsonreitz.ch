This is a quick post to introduce myself and write a few lines about the intentions behind this blog. 

I am a Front-end developer and designer living in Lausanne, Switzerland. My background is design-focused as I have a BA in Visual Communication. My coding skills come from self-learning.

These past years I have been working at a web agency and grew more and more interest in the Front-end development scene. It quickly became clear to me that only producing mocks and wireframes wasn't enough for my taste. I like to *actually* build the products that I design and code is now my tool of preference when it comes to creating a product.

Currently I'm mostly focused on finding new job opportunities as a Front-end dev / UX Engineer. Aside from that I'm tackling fun JAMstack stuff and getting more involved in the open-source software landscape.

With this blog, I want to share more! I think that writing is a great way to teach, learn and get involved with the community. I plan to publish regularly about Front-end thoughts with a focus on UX and usability.

That's it for now. If you want to get some smaller updates, don't hesitate to [follow me on Twitter](https:twitter.com/nelsreitz).
